    "# RAG Evaluation for Financial Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by providing relevant external knowledge, making it essential for financial analysis applications. This tutorial focuses on evaluating RAG systems that analyze internal AMD and NVIDIA research and market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will teach you to evaluate your financial RAG applications using LangSmith:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create targeted test datasets** with financial questions and expected answers\n",
    "2. **Run your RAG application** against comprehensive evaluation scenarios  \n",
    "3. **Measure performance** using specialized evaluation metrics for RAG systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG Evaluation Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluation process follows three essential steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Creation\n",
    "* Financial questions about AMD and NVIDIA performance, strategy, and market position\n",
    "* Expected answers based on internal analysis and market research\n",
    "* Edge cases covering complex financial scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. RAG Application Execution  \n",
    "* Query processing against your internal AMD/NVIDIA knowledge base\n",
    "* Document retrieval from financial reports, analysis, and market data\n",
    "* Answer generation combining retrieved context with LLM reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Multi-Dimensional Evaluation\n",
    "* **Answer relevance:** Does the response address the financial question asked?\n",
    "* **Answer accuracy:** Are the financial facts, figures, and analysis correct?\n",
    "* **Retrieval quality:** Did the system find the most relevant internal documents?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Focus\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll evaluate a financial analysis bot that answers questions about AMD and NVIDIA using your internal research database, ensuring reliable insights for investment and strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's begin by examining how RAG systems handle complex financial queries...*"

    "## RAG Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate your financial RAG system using four key dimensions. Each evaluator compares different components of the RAG pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Correctness: Response vs Reference Answer\n",
    "* **Goal:** How accurate is the financial analysis compared to expected answers?\n",
    "* **Requirements:** Ground truth answers in your dataset\n",
    "* **Method:** LLM-as-judge assesses factual accuracy of financial information\n",
    "* **Focus:** Validates correct financial metrics, trends, and company insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Relevance: Response vs Input Question  \n",
    "* **Goal:** How well does the answer address the original financial question?\n",
    "* **Requirements:** No reference answer needed\n",
    "* **Method:** LLM-as-judge evaluates response helpfulness and directness\n",
    "* **Focus:** Ensures answers stay on-topic for financial queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Groundedness: Response vs Retrieved Documents\n",
    "* **Goal:** How faithful is the response to the source financial documents?\n",
    "* **Requirements:** No reference answer needed  \n",
    "* **Method:** LLM-as-judge detects hallucinations and unsupported claims\n",
    "* **Focus:** Prevents fabricated financial data or analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Retrieval Relevance: Retrieved Docs vs Input Question\n",
    "* **Goal:** How relevant are the retrieved documents for answering the question?\n",
    "* **Requirements:** No reference answer needed\n",
    "* **Method:** LLM-as-judge assesses document-question alignment  \n",
    "* **Focus:** Validates that the right financial reports were found\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "Each metric provides unique insights into your RAG system's performance, helping identify whether issues stem from retrieval, generation, or both components.\n",
